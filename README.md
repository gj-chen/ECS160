Parcel Delivery App / Mi2U 

Cindy Chao, Gloria Chen, Jason Wan 

Our Parcel Delivery Application allows users to schedule deliveries with other registered users. We used PostgreSQL to create a locally hosted server and database and Google Maps API to allow users determine the shortest path and time necessary for delivery. Our parcel delivery service also allows users to choose from direct and indirect delivery. The intermediary deliver must also be a registered user.
